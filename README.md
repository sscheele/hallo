# Hallo
Hallo is a side project to see if I can make a Bonjour-like program for an old laptop.

## Philosophy
An alarm clock can never really be a personal assistant. To make sure it stays a fancy alarm clock, Hallo operates on the philosophy that once the user starts the program, they should very rarely be forced to directly interact with it. Therefore, unlike Bonjour, Hallo doesn't feature any manner of voice recognition. 

## Preparing for install
If you want to build from source, you have to `go get` gocui (`go get github.com/jroimartin/gocui`). However, pre-compiled binaries will be made available. You can run these with no dependencies.
